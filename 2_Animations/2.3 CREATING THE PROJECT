2.3 CREATING THE PROJECT

Create single view application in Xcode

We are using the facebook pop framework, so google those terms and go to the github repository. In the readme you will see the pod import statement.

in terminal:
pod init
vim Podfile
(paste in the import statement)

important vim keys:
i - insert
esc - clears your previous command
:x - save and exit

open the xcworkspace

CREATE A BRIDGING HEADER
Because Pop is a framework in ObjC, we need to create a bridging header to work with it in swift.

Simply create a new ObjectiveC file. It doesn't matter what it is, because we are only using it to get the prompt 'create a bridging header file'. We select it, and then delete the file that we just created. What is left behind is the bridging header file.

Now we can use the ObjC import statement #import <pop/POP.h> in the bridging header. Now you can go to any of your swift files and use the import pop statement. If for some reason you can't import, check that the use_frameworks! line is uncommented in your podfile, clean (comm k) and build (comm b).
